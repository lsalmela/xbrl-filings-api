Different language versions of the same report are separate filings.
Sometimes the exactly same report is filed twice due to errors in the
version filed earlier. Some entities also report on multiple markets
(different countries/stock exchanges). In the case of language versions
or same market refilings, the reports have the same `filing_index`
except for the last integer.
