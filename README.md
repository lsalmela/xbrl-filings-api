# XBRL Filings API

Python API for filings.xbrl.org XBRL report repository.

> **Note**
> This library is still under development.

As of July 2023, all the filings are Inline XBRL reports prepared in
accordance to the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF). This
means that the reporters have issued securities on European
regulated markets. In most of the cases these securities are shares,
but not always. Issuers on alternative stock exchanges such as the
Nordic exchange First North are exempted from ESEF mandate and thus
are not included.

The library is not connected to XBRL International.
